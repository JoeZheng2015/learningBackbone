/* This is the simplest Backbone.js program I could write that works on the screen.  
It just displays 'hello world' on the page; something you could get with a 1-line HTML file.  
So, obviously there must be some other benefit to using backbone.

BB has several other classes, but these are vital for web page and user control:
- Router is sortof the main control center
- View is any rectangle on the screen that you have to pump HTML or any changing data into.

Up until recently, your JS made web pages change by showing and hiding pieces of HTML.
And you construct that HTML into the HTML file, with all of the css display properties set to 'none'

The backbone approach is instead to generate the HTML for whatever you need to show.  Each view has
an empty element in the HTML that it fills with the generated HTML.  Usually it's easier 
if your JS fills in some sort of template for this html text, but that's not needed.

$(document).ready(function rdy()
{
  // as per jQuery, this runs after the page is set up, but other pieces 
  // like images may not have fully downloaded.
  
  // you need a view so you can see something.  You need some existing element on the 
  // page that will get filled with the content, that's el.
  // Note that ContentView is merely the class of the view you're making;
  // keep reading for instantiation.   
  // extend() creates a duplicate of Backbone.View, and attaches the passed variables 
  // to the prototype, so they become inherited instance variables of each constructed instance.
  var ContentView = Backbone.View.extend({
    // The element that you will stuff with html.  Do not set $el directly.  
    // Do not use id, attributes, className, or tagName despite what it says in the docs - too confusing.
    // set el to a CSS selector for the element you want; once you make an instance, 
    // its el points to the actual element, not jQuery wrapped.  $el is not set; go figure.
    el: 'body',
  
    // this is the code that you write that fills in the view's el with 'data' and html.
    // In this case, the container is the whole body, and the data is a fixed  string.
    render: function ()
    {
        $(this.el).html("hello world");
        return this;
    }
  });
  
  // the router is mission control.  It uses the new History facilities in HTML5 that allow the user to 
  // go back and forth between different URLs that actually point to states of this page.  In our case, there's one state.
  // Again note that NavigationRouter is merely the class; it is created at the bottom, 
  // with instance variables attached to the new constructor
  var NavigationRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    // routes calls handlers when certain events happen.  In our case, the only event happens when the page
    // first loads, "*actions".  defaultRoute() will get called when that happens to start it all up.
    // note you must have at least one route otherwise BB falls on its face.
    routes: {
        "*actions": "defaultRoute"
    },
    
    // called from the constructor for NavigationRouter, you write this function to kick it 
    // all off and create your first few views.
    initialize: function (options)
    {
      this.view = new ContentView({});          
      return this;
    },
    
    // called when page is loaded; calls content view to construct its content
    defaultRoute: function (actions)
